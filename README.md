# odin-recipes
Repository made for the Recipes project in The Odin Project

# The project:
This project includes creating an HTML page with links to other pages with recipes, including images. 

It demonstrates basic HTML skills, file management, and use of Git.

Later on, after learning CSS, it will be styled.

# Reflections:
… to be done after project is complete …
