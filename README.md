# odin-recipes
Repository made for the Recipes project in The Odin Project

# The project:
This project includes creating an HTML page with links to other pages with recipes, including images. 

It demonstrates basic HTML skills, file management, and use of Git.

Later on, after learning CSS, it will be styled.

# Reflections:
I found this project quite easy at first, but enjoyed using GPT-4 and Dall-E to generate the recipes and images. 

The HTML and file-management was fairly simple, and I look forward to styling it with CSS to make it look nice; right now it is quite brutalist...
